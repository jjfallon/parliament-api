    "On [data.parliament.uk](http://www.data.parliament.uk) Parliament has released a large number of APIs to aid access to their data. A full list of APIs can be found at [explore.data.parliament.uk](http://explore.data.parliament.uk). Note: most of these APIs are currently beta releases and may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Parliamentary questions the are a number of APIs:\n",
    "- Written questions to the House of Commons [(documentation here)](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/?learnmore=Commons%20Written%20Questions)and to the House of Lords [(documentation here)](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/?learnmore=Lords%20Written%20Questions).\n",
    "- Answered written questions to both Houses [(documentation here)](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/?learnmore=Parliamentary%20Questions%20Answered) and to individual Houses [(e.g. the House of Commons here)](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/?learnmore=Commons%20Answered%20Questions).\n",
    "- Oral questions to the Commons [(documentation here)](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/?learnmore=Commons%20Oral%20Questions) and to the Lords [(documentation here)](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/?learnmore=Lords%20Oral%20Questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will briefly demonstate how to use the Commons Written Questions API and the Parliamentary Questions Answered API using python. The other Parliamentary questions APIs follow a similiar pattern to these two so it should be straightforward to transfer these examples. "
